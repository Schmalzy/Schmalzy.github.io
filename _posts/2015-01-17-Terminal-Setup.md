I used [mdo's](https://github.com/mdo) bash profile and theme to spice up my terminal application. Togeather they are pretty awesome, so I thought I would share!

1. Open Terminal
2. Run `cd ~` to go to the home directory
3. Run `open -e .bash_profile` to edit your profile (TextEdit)
4. Paste in [@mdo's .bash_profile](https://github.com/mdo/config/blob/master/.bash_profile)
5. Download and set [@mdo's ocean-terminal theme](https://github.com/mdo/ocean-terminal)

It also comes with some pretty handy shortcuts for Git and Jekyll, which are pretty handy.
