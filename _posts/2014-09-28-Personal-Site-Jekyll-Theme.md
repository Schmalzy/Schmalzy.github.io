When I decided to rebuild my personal site from the ground up, there were a few key things I wanted to make sure I accomplished.

- Keep it as simple and clean as possible.
- Make a true Mobile First Responsive site.
- Make it open source.

With all this considered, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like the right way to go. 

### Jekyll Advantages
- No database required
- Built-in development server
- Built-in SASS compialing 
- Static pages for fast page-loads
- Markdown is used for writing posts
- Free hosting on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
