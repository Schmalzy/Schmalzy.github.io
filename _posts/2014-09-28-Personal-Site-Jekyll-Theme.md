### Personal Site 2.0

I was getting bored with my old personal site, as I am sure most developers do after any short period of time. It was built a couple years ago and was beginning to feel dated. So when I decided to rebuild it  from the ground up, there were a few key things I wanted to make sure I accomplished.

- Keep it as simple and clean as possible.
- Make it Mobile First and Responsive.
- Make it open source.

Previously, my personal site was built on WordPress, which seemed like massive over-kill for my purposes. With all this considered, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like the right way to go. 

### Jekyll Advantages
- No database required
- Built-in development server
- Built-in Sass compiling
- Modular by nature
- Static pages for fast page-loads
- Markdown is used for writing posts
- Free hosting on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Getting Started 

I found [this awesome article]( http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/) by Mark Otto on using Sass with Jekyll, which came with [this example](https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example) code. Using this as my starting point, I have to say I very-much enjoyed using Jekyll’s built-in development server and Sass compiler. It simplified my workflow by removing the need to use Grunt or any other third-party tool. All I needed was one Terminal Window, a Text-Editor and a browser. You can certainly use these tools with Jekyll (with-ease, and can be very powerful when combined) but this project was pretty basic and they were simply not needed because of Jekyll’s built-in goodies.

### Disclaimer

While I am a Web-Developer by day, I am most-definitely not a Designer. I wouldn’t even consider myself a real Front-End Web Developer. I write mostly server-side code, and because I mostly work on internal web applications for large corporation, the time allocated for design and front-end development is basically zero. Considering the company’s standard browser is IE8, and I am required to support IE7 as well, I don’t get to do much of what I would consider real Front-End Web Development. 

So this site is basically an excuse for me to try out modern web development techniques and try my hand at a little design. Any feedback (positive or negative) is always welcome.
