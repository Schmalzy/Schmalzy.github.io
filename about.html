<p>I'm a Web Developer for a Electronic Manufacturer in Wisconsin. I write mostly server-side code, and because I mostly work on internal web applications for a large corporation, the time allocated for design and front-end development is basically zero (frustrating). Considering the company’s standard browser is IE8, and I am required to support IE7 as well (lame), I don’t get to do much of what I would consider real Front-End Web Development (I need a new job).</p>

<p>So this site is basically an excuse for me to try out modern web development techniques and try my hand at a little design. Any feedback (positive or negative) is always welcome</p>

      <h3>{{ about_item.header }}</h3>
      <p>{{ about_item.description }}</p>
