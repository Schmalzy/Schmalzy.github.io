# My Personal Site

This is my personal site\blog built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It was inspired by Mark Otto's article on [Using Sass with Jekyll](http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/) and started using the [example template](https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example) from the article.
