# My Personal Site

This is my personal site\blog built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It was inspired by Mark Otto's article on [Using Sass with Jekyll](http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/) and started using the [example template](https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example) from the article.

## Work in Progress

This is still a work in progress. Once I have my personal site finished, I will create a sperate project with my content removed so that anyone can use it as a starting template.

## Features

- Moible-First and Responsive.
- Clean and simple design.
- Sass enabled.
- Automated navgiation.
- Global Sass variables for easy theme and payout tweeks
- Tagging system
