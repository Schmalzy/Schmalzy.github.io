# My Personal Site

This is my personal site\blog built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It was inspired by Mark Otto's article on [Using Sass with Jekyll](http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/) and started using the [example template](https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example) from the article.

## Work in Progress

This is still a work in progress. Once I have my personal site finished, I will create a sperate project with my content removed so that anyone can use it as a starting template.

## Features

- Moible-First and Responsive.
- Clean and simple design.
- Sass enabled.
- Automated navgiation.
- Global Sass variables for easy theme and payout tweeks
- Tagging system

## Disclaimer

While I am a Web-Developer by day, I am most-definitely not a Designer. I wouldn’t even consider myself a real Front-End Web Developer. I write mostly server-side code, and because I mostly work on internal web applications for a large corporation, the time allocated for design and front-end development is basically zero (frustrating). Considering the company’s standard browser is IE8, and I am required to support IE7 as well (lame), I don’t get to do much of what I would consider real Front-End Web Development (I need a new job). 

So this site is basically an excuse for me to try out modern web development techniques and try my hand at a little design. Any feedback (positive or negative) is always welcome.
