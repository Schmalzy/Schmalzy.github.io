  <h2 class="post-title">Jekyll Theme For a Personal Site</h2>
  <p class="post-date">September 28, 2014 -

  <h3 id="personal-site-20">Personal Site 2.0</h3>

<p>I was getting bored with my old personal site, as I am sure most developers do after any short period of time. It was built a couple years ago and was beginning to feel dated. So when I decided to rebuild it  from the ground up, there were a few key things I wanted to make sure I accomplished.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep it as simple and clean as possible.</li>
  <li>Make it Mobile First and Responsive.</li>
  <li>Make it open source.</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, my personal site was built on WordPress, which seemed like massive over-kill for my purposes. With all this considered, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> seemed like the right way to go. </p>

<h3 id="jekyll-advantages">Jekyll Advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No database required</li>
  <li>No security concerns</li>
  <li>Built-in development server</li>
  <li>Built-in Sass compiling</li>
  <li>Modular by nature</li>
  <li>Static pages for fast page-loads</li>
  <li>Markdown is used for writing posts</li>
  <li>Free hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

<p>I found <a href="http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/">this awesome article</a> by Mark Otto on using Sass with Jekyll, which came with <a href="https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example">this example</a> code. Using this as my starting point, I have to say I very-much enjoyed using Jekyll’s built-in development server and Sass compiler. It simplified my workflow by removing the need to use Grunt or any other third-party tool. All I needed was one Terminal Window, a Text-Editor and a browser. You can certainly use these tools with Jekyll (with-ease, and can be very powerful when combined) but this project was pretty basic and they were simply not needed because of Jekyll’s built-in goodies.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>

<p>While I am a Web-Developer by day, I am most-definitely not a Designer. I wouldn’t even consider myself a real Front-End Web Developer. I write mostly server-side code, and because I mostly work on internal web applications for a large corporation, the time allocated for design and front-end development is basically zero (frustrating). Considering the company’s standard browser is IE8, and I am required to support IE7 as well (lame), I don’t get to do much of what I would consider real Front-End Web Development (I need a new job). </p>

<p>So this site is basically an excuse for me to try out modern web development techniques and try my hand at a little design. Any feedback (positive or negative) is always welcome. </p>
