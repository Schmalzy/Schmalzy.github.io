When attempting to use the column ordering features in Bootstrap 3, I found that it was pretty confusing at first. Normally the [Bootstrap Documentation]( http://getbootstrap.com/css/) is stellar, but the section on [Column Ordering](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-column-ordering) is really lacking some important details. 

> Easily change the order of our built-in grid columns with .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* modifier classes.
>
>    <div class="row">
>      <div class="col-md-9 col-md-push-3">.col-md-9 .col-md-push-3</div>
>      <div class="col-md-3 col-md-pull-9">.col-md-3 .col-md-pull-9</div>
>    </div>

And that's about it.
